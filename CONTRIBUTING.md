You can give us suggestions, and we might add them ( your name will apear as a comment in the code and on the contributors page ). You can tell us issues or errors you found ( your name will apear as a comment in the code and on the contributors page ).
Do you wanna do more? You can fix issues and send them to us ( your name will apear as a comment in the code and on the contributors page ). You can add items, rooms, spells to the premade libraries ( your name will apear as a comment in the code and on the contributors page ). You can add other modules or contribute to them ( your name will apear as a comment in the code and on the contributors page ).
